# ARK (Autonomous Repository of Knowledge)

**ARK** is a locally-run, voice-enabled AI assistant built to support resilience, permaculture, off-grid living, and self-sovereignty in the face of modern digital chaos.

> Designed as both a daily-use assistant and a fallback digital sanctuary in case of systemic collapse.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What It Does

- Runs multiple **GGUF LLMs** locally using GPU acceleration.
- Switchable **voice synthesis** (via K≈çki TTS2 and custom cloned voices).
- Modular command-line interface for:
  - Choosing model
  - Activating voice
  - Listening and responding
- Intended future features:
  - Local/offline mobile app
  - Web UI (Famous.ai frontend)
  - Avatar-based personalities
  - Crypto DAO interaction (XRP Ledger: FoodScapeCoin, FarmCoin, DowCoin)
  - Knowledge modules for permaculture, herbal medicine, and biblical preparedness

## üîß How to Use

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements: Python, GPU with 8GB+, Koqui TTS, GGUF-compatible runner

```bash
